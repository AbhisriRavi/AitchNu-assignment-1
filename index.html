  <h2> Chemistry is a <q>branch of science</q></h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, composition, structure, and the changes it undergoes during chemical reactions. It explores how substances interact, combine, and transform, providing insights into everything from the formation of molecules to the behavior of materials in everyday life. Chemistry is often called the "central science" because it connects physics with other natural sciences, including biology and environmental science. Key concepts include the periodic table, chemical bonds, reactions, and thermodynamics, all of which help explain the nature of substances and the processes that occur in our world. </p>
  <hr>
  <aitch>It is divided into 2 categories:
  <pre>
    <a>1. Organic Chemistry</a>
    <a>2. Inorganic Chemistry</a>
  </pre>
  </aitch>
  <p>
    <b class="fs">1. <i> Organic Chemistry</i></b><br>
    <aa style="text-align:justify;padding-left:20px;">Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry focused on the <u>study of carbon-containing compounds</u>, including their structures, properties, reactions, and synthesis. It encompasses a vast range of substances, from simple molecules like methane to complex macromolecules like proteins and DNA. Organic chemistry plays a crucial role in fields such as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and biochemistry, impacting everything from medicine to agriculture. </aa>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b class="fs">2. <i> Inorganic Chemistry</i></b><br>
    <aa style="text-align:justify;padding-left:20px;">Inorganic chemistry is the <u>study of inorganic compounds</u>, which primarily include minerals and metals, rather than carbon-based compounds. This branch focuses on the properties, structures, and reactions of a wide range of substances, including metals, salts, and coordination compounds. Inorganic chemistry is essential for understanding materials science, catalysis, and biological processes, as well as industrial applications such as ceramics and fertilizers. </aa>
